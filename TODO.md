  This is simply a list of TODO, in order of priority to make this library fully usable and
  a decent library for people who do not wish to use the more popular libraries because they don't use a language they are familiar with

  
- Add a method to check the list of pending users
- Add method to refuse a user who is pending to join a group
- Add a method to switch whetever the group is public or private (whetever it requires the user to be manually accepted)
- Figure out why it seems to be crashing every 5-7 days (Seems to be most likely an issue on coro-http or secure-http's side, or outdated lib)
- Add onPost events
- Add onShout events
- Add onPending events
- Add the ability to interact with game settings like gamepasses
- Document the code
- Write a proper wiki which explains how to use most things
